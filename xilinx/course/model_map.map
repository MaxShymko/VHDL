  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        7,142
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         6,508 out of   7,142   91%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   7 out of   7,142    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         627 out of   7,142    8%
    Number of unique control sets:              58
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             150 out of 408,000    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
